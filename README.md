An Elixir DSL for conveniently loading binary data/files.


Work In Progress
----------------

It is currently a work in progress, and as it stands isn't particularly useful at the moment.


To-Do
-----

 * Conditionals
 * Automatically use loader on extension and magic number match
 * Pass loading off to another module
 * Add specs
 * Convenient types for things like strings
 * Skips (get data but don't add data to loaded data)
 * Optionals (can safely get data if it exists or doesn't)

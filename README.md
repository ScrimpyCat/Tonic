An Elixir DSL for conveniently loading binary data/files.


Work In Progress
----------------

It is currently a work in progress, and as it stands isn't particularly useful at the moment.


To-Do
-----

 * Automatically use loader on extension and magic number match
 * Pass loading off to another module
 * Convenient types
 * Optionals (can safely get data if it exists or doesn't)
 * Change repeat step callback to pass in current length
 * Add a repeat/5 where you can pass in the option whether the list should be reversed or not

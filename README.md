An Elixir DSL for conveniently loading binary data/files.


Work In Progress
----------------

It is currently a work in progress, and as it stands isn't particularly useful at the moment.


To-Do
-----

 * Make it able to use data currently loaded, within other load operations
 * Conditionals
 * Automatically use loader on extension and magic number match
 * Pass loading off to another module
 * Add specs
 * Allow for groups to be overriden (their result changed)
